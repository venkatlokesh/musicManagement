# musicManagement
This is a simple music management system where u can add ur song play it or delete a song or u can view all ur songs.
For this project I used django frame work.
I tried to add a feature of downloading a song by using a url of that song but by using django it is very difficult to do it so i give up.
I populated random data in audio-url field since it was difficult to find url.
django can be installed using pip3 install django command and go to the folder where manage.py resides and run a command python3 manage.py runserver
